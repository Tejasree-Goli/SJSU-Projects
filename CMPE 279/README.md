### Detection of Cyber Security Threats

**Objective:** With the increasing number of systems connecting to the internet, safeguarding networks against various cyber threats has become more critical than ever. The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, prompting companies to invest millions in advanced technologies to protect their businesses and fortify defenses against potential attacks. To address these challenges, leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technology is crucial for automating the detection and response to cyber threats. 

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model for a network intrusion detection system. The primary goal is to provide a binary classification of results by identifying whether the input network log is an attack or benign. 

Organizations can benefit from these technologies by automating the detection of outlier patterns in networks and flagging systems that do not comply with organizational standards. This proactive approach enhances the overall cybersecurity posture and helps prevent potential threats before they can cause harm.

**Results:** The classifier showed promising results in differentiating between attack and benign traffic. Features like Flow Duration and Total Forward Packets were particularly effective in identifying specific attack types. The TCP Flag Counts, especially the PSH flag, emerged as a significant indicator of benign traffic. We achieved a model accuracy of 0.99.
