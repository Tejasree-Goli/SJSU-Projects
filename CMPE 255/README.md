## Performance Comparison of ML Algorihms for Text Classification


**Dataset**: 

Large Movie Review Dataset. 
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well.

**Dataset Source**: 
[Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
    
**Problem Statement**:

**Objective:** To create pipelines for text classification/sentiment analysis using different Machine Learning Algorithms and perform a comparative study to evaluate the performance of different models on the Large Movie Review Dataset

**Approach:** A general process of applying algorithms for classification includes text pre-processing, feature selection, implementation of ML models and finally, evaluation of the testing dataset. Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression algorithms will be used to train the models and the performance of these models will be analyzed using the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F-score, recall, precision and confusion matrix.
